# Facebook messaging reminder

```In GSG we host many events and ask people to register via Google Forms. However then we spend a lot of time reaching them out and making sure they are coming. Hani does that via Facebook Messenger manually which is quite inefficient (that's why he is late with our food). Let's build an app and bot, which goes through the Google Sheet with the names and sends a Facebook Messenger reminder asking them to confirm.```

# - Phase 1:

# User stories:
 - As a user, when open the site , he should type his google acount and a password.
 - After that admin should select the name of sheet from selcted list.
 - Then he should choose the action he wants(SMS, bot and remider) from selcted list.
 - after that , he should click send button to send selcted action.
 - Finally, the report will display contain the name of people who confirm their submission.
